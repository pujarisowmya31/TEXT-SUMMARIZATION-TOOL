From automating routine tasks to powering complex systems like self-driving cars and personalized medicine, AI has become an integral part of modern life. One of the most significant advancements is in natural language processing, enabling machines to understand and generate human language. Businesses are increasingly adopting AI to streamline operations, enhance customer experiences, and gain insights from vast amounts of data. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Ethical concerns such as bias, privacy, and job displacement are also gaining attention. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential to create frameworks that ensure responsible development and deployment, balancing innovation with societal impact.\n"
