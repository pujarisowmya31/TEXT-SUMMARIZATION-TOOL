DESCRIPTION OF TASK(What is Text Summarization?
Text summarization is the process of shortening a large text document while preserving its key information and overall meaning. It plays a crucial role in today's data-driven world where users need to digest massive amounts of content quickly. Whether itâ€™s summarizing news articles, research papers, or blog posts, AI-powered summarization tools help in improving efficiency, productivity, and decision-making.

There are two main types of summarization:

Extractive Summarization: Selects key sentences directly from the text.

Abstractive Summarization: Generates new sentences that capture the meaning of the original content (similar to how humans summarize).

This project uses abstractive summarization via a powerful transformer-based model.

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
Python â€“ Main programming language.

Hugging Face Transformers â€“ To access pre-trained NLP models.

BART Model (facebook/bart-large-cnn) â€“ A state-of-the-art transformer for summarization.

Torch â€“ Required for model execution.

SentencePiece â€“ Tokenizer support.

ðŸ’» How It Works
The user provides a long text (e.g., a news article).

The input is tokenized and processed using the pre-trained BART model.

The model generates a summarized version of the input.

The output is printed in the console or displayed in a web interface.)
